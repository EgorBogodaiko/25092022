## How to work w/ hub

Mainly we have 2 ways of working: **push** n **pull**

**Push** is dedicated to send local repo to the net.

**Pull** is to load changes from Hub directly - so doing request from your browser to load changes from local file to the net.
These are the basics of using vervion controlling tool called "Git".

To perform **Push** we need firstly to create a repo in the hub, where we will send our local repo.
Login into github, create repo, copy appeared link to it.


To perform **Pull** we need to act in the browser.
Firstly appear changes to the local repo of branch main commiting it.
